# Product carbon footprint MySQL

Exploratory analysis about the product carbon footprint with MySQL

By using the open dataset of the Carbon Catalogue1, which stores Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) of different companies, I tried to analyse and visualise greenhouse gas emissions linkable to a particular product, measured in CO2 in 2013.

I used a smaller version of the database by looking at the following variables: (1) id of the product, (2) year, (3) name of the product, (4) company name, (5) country, (6) industry group, (7) carbon footprint, (8) emissions occurring before the company's starts its own operations related (called upstream), (9) emissions that the company creates during the production process (called operations), (10) emissions occurring after the product leaves the premises of the company (called downstream).

The aim of this analysis is to apply basic concept of MySQL to a real case scenario.
